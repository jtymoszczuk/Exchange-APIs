# Exchange-APIs

Work-in-process 👷‍♂️

Just playing with the kraken api to allow for faster deposit/withdrawals while also learning my way around github.

In the .env add your Kraken api key and secret to interact with your kraken account remotely. Looking to add more to this and make it more interactive.

## Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/jtymoszczuk/Exchange-APIs.git
cd kraken-api-test
cp sample-.env .env
```
