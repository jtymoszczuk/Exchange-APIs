# kraken-api-test

Work-in-process 👷‍♂️

Just playing with the kraken api to allow for faster deposit/withdrawals while also learning my way around github.

In the .env add your Kraken api key and secret to interact with your kraken account remotely.

## Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/jtymoszczuk/Exchange-APIs.git
cd kraken-api-test
cp sample-.env .env
```
